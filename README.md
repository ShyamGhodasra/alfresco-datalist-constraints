=============================

Use datalists to maintain Alfresco model constraints:

1. Deploy repo and share AMPs to Alfresco 4.2 CE
2. Create a new site named "Administration"
3. Configure site dashboard to include Datalists
4. Create two new datalists from type "Options", one called "Smartphones" and another called "OS"
5. Populate the datalists with some values (01 - Android, 02 - iOS...)
6. Create a new site (with any name)
7. Upload a new document
8. Add "Sample" aspect to document
9. On "Option lists" section you should see two new fields ("option" and "another option") with combos showing the data populated on step 5
